# About Me

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lindsey, a fourth-year Computing Sciences student at Thompson Rivers University (TRU). Here's a glimpse into my academic journey and interests:

## Academic Background

I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computing Sciences at TRU, focusing on software development, engineering, and cybersecurity. The dynamic field of computing has been an exciting and challenging journey, and I'm thrilled to be in my fourth year, delving deeper into these domains.

Before my venture into computing, I earned degrees in Psychology and Health Sciences, bringing a diverse perspective to my current academic pursuits. These previous educational paths have provided me with unique insights that I'm eager to integrate into the world of technology.

## Interests

- **Software Development & Engineering:** I have a passion for creating innovative solutions and exploring the intricacies of software development and engineering.
  
- **Cybersecurity:** The ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity fascinates me, and I enjoy staying updated on the latest trends and challenges in this field. I particularly enjoy writing and breaking code, and assisting other in maintaining secure practices with their devices.

- **IT Consulting:** I am keen on exploring the realm of IT consulting, leveraging my technical skills to provide valuable insights and solutions for businesses. I recently started my own technology service IT consulting business and my hope is to expand into writing software applications and systems, as well incorporating ethical penetration testing into my repertoire.

## Future Paths

I'm excited to forge paths that integrate my background in psychology and health sciences with my computing expertise. The interdisciplinary approach is something I find immensely valuable, and I look forward to contributing to both the technological and human aspects of the industries I'm involved in.

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn  to discuss anything related to computing, technology, or even to share book recommendations! Let's connect and explore the vast world of possibilities together.

Thanks for viewing this page! ðŸš€
